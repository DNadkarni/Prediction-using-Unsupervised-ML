OBJECTIVE-Clustering of Iris Dataset

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

ALGORITHM USED -  K-Means

K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that orchestrates a choreographed ballet of data points in a multidimensional space, gracefully partitioning them into clusters of similar entities. With a mathematical elegance akin to a well-choreographed dance, K-Means seeks to minimize the inertia, delicately orchestrating centroids to find the most harmonious arrangement. Through iterative refinement, it unveils hidden structures, allowing us to discern patterns in the symphony of data, ultimately illuminating the underlying order within the apparent chaos.
